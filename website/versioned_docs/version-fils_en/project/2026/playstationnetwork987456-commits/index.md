## Description

Reaction Gamepad is a fully functional implementation of a reaction-based game system, running on an STM32 microcontroller. The player uses 8 physical buttons connected to the microcontroller, which communicates with a PC via USB as a gamepad device. The game displays on the PC monitor through a custom graphics engine. Features include multiple game modes, difficulty levels, and visual feedback systems.

## Motivation

This project demonstrates embedded game development on microcontrollers. It combines real-time input handling, game state management, USB protocol implementation, and Rust embedded systems programming. The reaction gamepad serves as a practical platform for learning microcontroller programming while creating an engaging interactive experience.

## Architecture

**Main Components:**

* **STM32U545RETx Microcontroller**: Central processor running game logic, manages GPIO input and USB output
* **8 Physical Buttons**: User input connected to GPIO pins with debouncing
* **USB Gamepad Emulation**: HID protocol implementation for PC communication
* **Game State Manager**: Handles game state, score, and level progression
* **Collision Detection Engine**: Detects input validation and timing

**How They Connect:**

* Buttons connect to GPIO pins → Firmware reads debounced input
* Game logic updates based on button input
* Game state is converted to HID gamepad commands
* PC receives gamepad data via USB and renders graphics/audio

## Log

### Week 5 - 11 May

Project concept selected. Decided to build a reaction-based gamepad using STM32U545RETx microcontroller. First version will use buttons as input with PC display for visual feedback.

### Week 12 - 18 May

Hardware architecture planned. Buttons configured as GPIO inputs. Main software logic designed with game loop structure and timing measurement.

### Week 19 - 25 May

Documentation page created. Project description, motivation, architecture, hardware plan, and software plan documented. Game modes and difficulty levels finalized in design.

## Hardware

STM32U545RETx (Nucleo-U545RE-Q) development board serves as the main microcontroller. Prototype built on breadboard using 8 push buttons for input, USB connection to PC for gamepad communication. Buttons connected via GPIO pins with pull-down resistors for debouncing. All power supplied via USB cable.
